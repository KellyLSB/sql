SQL Bundle
==========
Some of you might ask "Kelly, why are you rewriting the EvolutionSDK SQL Bundle?" to which I will answer "Because I wrote it before I knew exactly what a PHP Object was and how to use it right." Kinda shocking now. While I wrote that bundle way back in the fall of 2011 and I am proud of it; it was written messily, it was developed upon messily and it was extended messily. So now I am going back to the basics, I am removing most of the chaf and am creating a new bundle with more optimized code, a lighter model, a lighter list, lighter connection interface, and most importantly a lighter/safer architect.

## Can this be used standalone independent of EvolutionSDK?
Sure I don't see why not just make sure you remove the dependencies.
